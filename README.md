# ui5-deployer-cli
Modified version of ui5-cli to work with ui5-deployer.

It's an experimental module, don't use it for real! There's no NPM module for it, you consume it from GitHub only.

This module is used for testing:
- ui5-deployer: https://github.com/mauriciolauffer/ui5-deployer
- ui5-deployer-app-test: https://github.com/mauriciolauffer/ui5-deployer-app-test
